# MyReads Project

This app can be built and run locally with `npm start` or you can visit the live version at

This project serves as a demonstration of React fundamentals. It is a simple book tracker with a
search page and three shelves, "Currently Reading", "Want to Read", and "Read". Books can be found
using search and moved around on the shelves or removed entirely.
